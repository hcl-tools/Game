# Mani-Template
The project was created as a base project to make it easier for anyone wanting to build
projects with Máni.

## How to use
Simply click the `use template` button on github...
Then put all ur code in the src folder. When you run or build... it will download
the base repo of Máni once, then it will just work on that.

## Running
Simply run the `run.sh` file to run your code.

## Building
Simply run the `build.sh` file, this will create a `Compiled.jar` in the root directroy for you.

## Updating / Cleaning
To update Máni to the latest version, or to clean your pack for pushing to github...
run the `clean.sh` file. This will remove the build folder and Compiled.jar file from the root directory.
